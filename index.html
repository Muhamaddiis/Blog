        <h3>ChatGpt</h3>
        <div class="para">
            <p> ChatGpt has recently been released to the public and I’ve had the chance to play around with it.
            It’s a powerful tool that can help with a number of tasks, from creating high-level summaries to quickly brainstorming ideas.
            It can even generate the feel of documents that can then be further customized, such as an admissions essay. </p>
            <p> being able to ask a question and get an answer in a fraction of a second.
            Imagine being able to quickly generate content that is both relevant and engaging. This is the power of ChatGPT, a new
            generative-AI technology that is transforming the way we interact with machines and with each other. </p>
            <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence system that combines natural language processing with deep learning.
            It uses sophisticated algorithms to understand language, generate conversations, and respond to questions
            with accurate and insightful answers.
            What’s more, it can do all of this in real-time, meaning that you can receive an answer to your query in mere seconds. </p>

            <p> This tool can be useful in a number of scenarios. For example, a writer who is tasked with creating a
            blog post on a tight deadline can use ChatGPT to quickly generate a basic outline of the post.
            By inputting the topic and some key points they want to cover,
            the ChatGPT can generate a list of relevant points, quotes, and statistics to include in the post.
            From there, the writer can quickly fill out the post with their own voice, knowledge, and insights
            to craft an engaging and informative piece of writing. With ChatGPT, the writer can save time and energy,
            allowing them to focus on the more creative aspects of the post and still deliver a high-quality piece of content. </p>
